## üîß Core Implementations

### 1. üèóÔ∏è CNN from Scratch
- Implemented a convolutional neural network using PyTorch without using any high-level APIs.
- Components include: convolutional layers, ReLU, pooling, flattening, fully connected layers.
- Focused on understanding the flow of data in CNNs and their forward/backward passes.

### 2. ‚úÖ Binary Classification (e.g., Cat vs Dog)
- Dataset: [Mention dataset e.g., Kaggle Dogs vs Cats]
- Framework: PyTorch
- Techniques:
  - Image preprocessing and data augmentation
  - Model training with evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

### 3. üéØ Multiclass Classification (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST)
- Dataset: [Mention dataset name]
- Implemented deep learning models for classifying multiple classes.
- Applied data loaders, loss functions, optimizers, and trained using GPU.
