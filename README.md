# 🧠 Computer Vision Project Hub

Welcome! This repository is a collection of projects across **core Computer Vision tasks**, implemented with PyTorch and other open-source libraries. It includes beginner-friendly projects (like CNN from scratch) and extends to advanced topics such as segmentation, image captioning, VQA, and 3D vision.

## ➕ Adding New Projects

Each project lives in its own folder with:
- Code (`.ipynb`, `.py`)
- `README.md` describing the task, dataset, and method
- Optional: demo app (Streamlit, Gradio)

To add a new project:
```bash
mkdir new-task-folder
# Add code, dataset link, results, and update this README
